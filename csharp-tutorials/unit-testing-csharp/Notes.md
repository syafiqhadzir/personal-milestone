# Unit Test

## You make code changes and it breaks somewhere else

- Why? You work on a team.
- You work on a code base with thousands of files, classes, etc.
- You make changes.
- Code breaks or introduce bugs.
- Project fails, toxic work environment, nobody wants to work for you.

## Hard Fast Rules

- Unit testing is an art.
- Click a button and run hundreds.
- Too many or too little is bad.
- Don't use VS Code.
- All the framework are the same.
- Unit test what constantly changes or is critical.
