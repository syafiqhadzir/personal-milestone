# CSS: Types of Colors

## What is HEX & RGB?

HEX, or hexadecimal numbers, is a human-friendly way to communicate color to computers. There is no informational difference between RGB and HEX colors; they are simply different ways of communicating the same thing â€“ a red, green, and blue color value.

HEX, along with its sister RGB, is one of the color languages used in coding, such as CSS. HEX is a numeric character based reference of RGB numbers.

Whereas we typically count in units of 10, the hexadecimal system is in units of 16: 0-9, A-F. Each of the three RGB numbers is converted using mathematical equations from a 3 digit number to a 2 digit alphanumeric combination. (For instance a value of 255 red would be #FF).
