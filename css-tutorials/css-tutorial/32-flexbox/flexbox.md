# CSS Flexbox

## What is a flexbox?

- Flexbox stands for 'flexible box'.
- It is a display type that comes with a range of properties allowing you to arrange items easily.
- It is an alternative to using displays, floats, and other layout properties.

### Flexbox Components

- A flexbox element is split into two main parts: the container, and the items.
- The container is the parent element in which the display type is active. This is usually in the form of a div.
- Flex items are child elements of the container, and make up the contents of the box.
