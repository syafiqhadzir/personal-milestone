# Grid vs Flexbox

## Introduction

- Similar to Flexbox, Grid is a display type that can be used to activate certain layout features on a container element.
- They are both alternatives to other layout features available in CSS.

## Differences

- However, these two display types work in very different ways.
- The Grid system is more manual, providing you with more tools to layout your container in a specific way.
- Grid is also very focused on providing tools for both dimensions (width + height), whereas Flexbox is focused on width alone.
