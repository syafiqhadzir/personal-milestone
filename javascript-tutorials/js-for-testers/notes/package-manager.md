**Package Managers**

1. **NPM**

   - Registry or repository of open-source packages
   - Largest JS library repository
   - CLI
   - Website (npmjs.com/pkg)

2. **Yarn**

3. **NPX**

Easily run local commands, installation-less execution.

    * Without NPX: node ./node_modules/.bin/mocha
    * With NPX: npx mocha

Notes: packages can be installed on both locally and globally (discouraged).
