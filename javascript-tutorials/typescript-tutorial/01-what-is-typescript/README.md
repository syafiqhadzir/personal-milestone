# What Is TypeScript?
Edited on 12:39, November 2nd, 2022

## Introduction

According to Vanderkam (2019), TypeScript is a _superset_ of JavaScript in a syntactic[^1] sense: so long as your JavaScript program doesnâ€™t have any syntax errors then it is also a TypeScript program.

However, TypeScript is not a superset in a semantic[^2] sense: TypeScript programs can have semantic errors that JavaScript programs don't have. For example, TypeScript programs can have type errors that JavaScript programs don't.

## Strong (Static) vs Weak (Dynamic) Typing

TypeScript is a _strongly typed_ language. This means that the type of a variable is known at compile time. In contrast, JavaScript is a _weakly typed_ language. This means that the type of a variable is known at runtime.
