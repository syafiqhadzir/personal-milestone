**Internet Protocol (IP) Address**

Every device (for example, computers, printers, routers, and gaming consoles)
on a network must have a unique address. An IP address consists of four sets
of numbers from 0 to 255, separated by a decimal (for example, 192.168.1.200).

**Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol**

A DHCP Server is a network server that automatically provides and assigns
IP addresses, default gateways and other network parameters to client devices.
It relies on the standard protocol (DHCP) to respond to broadcast queries by clients.

**What is the difference between a dynamic and static IP address?**

When a device is assigned a static IP address, the address does not change.
Most devices use dynamic IP addresses, which are assigned by the network
when they connect and change over time.

**What is a port?**
A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end.
Ports are software-based and managed by a computer's operating system.
Each port is associated with a specific process or service. Ports
allow computers to easily differentiate between different kinds of
traffic: emails go to a different port than webpages, for instance,
even though both reach a computer over the same Internet connection.

There are 65,535 possible port numbers, although not all are in common use.
Some of the most commonly used ports, along with their associated networking
protocol, are:
